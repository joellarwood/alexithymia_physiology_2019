The study required participants to listen to a series of musical clips for 30 seconds each. Each clip was presented twice and participants rated the valence of the clip, the arousal of the clip, how much they liked the clip, and the extent to which a certain emotions where experienced during listening. Electrophysiological data was collected from the zygomaticus and corugator using facial EMG as well as electrodermal activity. This data was collected continuously with the beginning of each song marked by a event marker.
